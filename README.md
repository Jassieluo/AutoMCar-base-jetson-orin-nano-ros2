An autonomous obstacle avoidance tracking vehicle project based on Jetson Orin Nano and ros2.
The weights folder contains the weights of the model that may be used.
The engine quantization models in weights folder are all obtained with TensorRT10 on jetson orin nano.
The weights folder in the weights archive(weights.zip).
